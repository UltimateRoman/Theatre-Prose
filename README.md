### What it does

Theatre Pros(e) is a GUI application which can play scripts from popular theatre plays. It is intended to help people experience theatre plays digitally and tries to simulate an in-person theatre experience to some regard. The app has 2 modes -

1) Single-player mode: It enables the user to select a character/player from a particular play and emulate their dialogues. Based on how well the user spoke their lines, a score is computed. If the user gets a perfect score, they receive a standing ovation!

2) Multi-player mode: The App plays the script for the theatre play chosen by the user. This is a fun way to engage with other theatre-enthusiasts.
